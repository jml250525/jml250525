I am a PhD Candidate in Management Science at College of Business, University of Texas at Arlington. I am interested in adopting behavioral angle to understand and improve supply chain and operations management decisions. My dissertation blends analytical and experimental methods to investigate decision-making problems in supply chain risk management and strategic sourcing. Specifically, I focus on how supplier-induced risks influence sourcing decisions and how geopolitical risks influence vaccine manufacturersâ€™ capacity investment decisions. In my other research, I address how consumer and employee behavior can impact operations management decisions.

I have taught one undergraduate course on supply chain and operations management and have extensive teaching assistance experience in different supply chain and operations management courses.
