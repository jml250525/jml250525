<sw>Hello!</sw><br>

<hw>
I am a PhD Candidate in Management Science at College of Business, University of Texas at Arlington. My research lies at the interface among behavioral operations, business analytics and theoretic modeling, with a focus on business context in complex supply chain networks. My main research blends different research methodologies to uncover novel managerial insights related to strategic sourcing and collaborative/competitive negotiation in different supply chain network structures. In my other research, I study on the applications of machine learning and AI in the areas of operations management and digital marketing.

<hw>
I have been teaching two introductory undergraduate courses on supply chain/operations management and business analytics for over two years. Also, I have extensive teaching assistance experience in various supply chain/operations management courses.
