  ## Abstract
 We examine implications of retail level competition on supply contract negotiations
when retailers have asymmetric supplier bases. We represent the asymmetric supplier bases with
a two-retailer-two-supplier network in which one retailer has access to both suppliers and other
retailer has access to only one supplier. The retailers first negotiate supply contracts with their
suppliers to gain exclusive selling rights and then the retailers who manage to secure a contract
with a supplier choose their market prices. The asymmetric structure of supply network together
with retailer level competition dynamics determine the contract bargaining incentives of retailers
and suppliers. We find that supply chain network asymmetry can lead to a retail monopoly when
the suppliers’ products are sufficiently substitutable. Further, if the substitutability level continues
to rise, the retailer with larger supplier base gain benefits in contract agreement through negotiations.
We also show that total industry profits can be higher under asymmetric network structure
as compared to that under complete network structure. Overall, our research suggests that the
supply chain network structure can fundamentally impact firms’ contracting behaviors, and thus,
needs to be considered to better reflect the reality of contractual negotiation under competition.
