<br><br><details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
We build a game-theoretic model to examine supply contract negotiations under competition when retailers have asymmetric supplier bases. We represent the asymmetric supplier bases with a two-retailer-two-supplier network in which one retailer has access to both suppliers and other retailer has access to only one supplier. The retailers first negotiate supply contracts with their suppliers to gain exclusive selling rights and then the retailers who manage to secure a contract with a supplier choose their market prices. The asymmetric structure of supply network together with retailer level competition dynamics determine the contract bargaining incentives of retailers and suppliers. We find that supply chain network asymmetry can lead to a retail monopoly when the suppliers' products are sufficiently substitutable. Further, if the substitutability level continues to rise, the retailer with larger supplier base gain benefits in contract agreement through negotiations. We also show that total industry profits can be higher under asymmetric network structure as compared to that under complete network structure. Overall, our research suggests that the supply chain network structure can fundamentally impact firms' contracting behaviors, and thus, needs to be considered to better reflect the reality of contractual negotiation under competition.</details>

<br><ol start=2><li><strong>Desperateness in Contract Bargaining under Supply Chain Networks</strong>. Joint work with Alper Nakkas, Kay-Yut Chen and Jason (Xianghua) Wu. soonly submit to <em>Mnagement Science</em>.</li></ol>

<details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
This paper theoretically and behaviorally studies contract bargaining in two-sided supply chain networks where retailers on the demand side purchase products from suppliers on the supply side. The retailers may have heterogeneous market valuations on the products ordered from the supply partner. In such a supply chain network, a retailer and a supplier must have a business relationship or "link" to bargain and trade with each other. However, a firm on one side of the supply chain network might not have a business relationship with every firm on the other side. Our experimental data suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal behavioral regularities on contracting behaviors. In particular, we show that players who link with more (or less) potential partners and/or who have more (or less) perceived values tend to earn more (or less) than expectation in games. We develop a new behavioral theory, referred to as \textit{desperateness theory}, which explains and predicts the contract bargaining behaviors in two-sided supply chain networks. We demonstrate that firm(s) who link with less potential partner or who have less perceived values in the networks are more desperate of making contract agreement, and thus need to "sacrifice" part of the contract bargaining payoffs when bargaining with the corresponding "advantageous" firm(s). We also find evidence that the higher the total desperateness within the supply chain network, the lower the total supply chain profit.</details><br>

<hr><ol start=3><li><strong>Vaccine Nationalism: Implications of Government Mandates on Vaccine Manufacturing and Public Health Outcomes</strong>. Joint work with Karen Donohue and Karthik Natarajan. Analysis in progress.</li></ol><details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented pressure on healthcare supply chains. Due to the limited supply of critical products such as PPEs and drugs, several national governments have implemented policies to limit the exporting of such products. As the success of combating the pandemic hinges on the availability of vaccines, there are growing concerns that governments might take similar measures to prioritize supplying vaccines to their own citizens, a phenomenon dubbed by the media as "vaccine nationalism." Against this backdrop, we investigate potential implications of such government mandates on vaccine manufacturers' capacity investment decisions and the associated public health outcomes. Our analysis shows that these mandates do not necessarily result in the intended consequences of increasing the local availability of vaccine doses. In some situations, the policies may actually induce the manufacturer to diversify production to another country. Also, the local, and sometimes even total, capacities may decrease if the capacity investment cost is high. We further study how the associated changes in capacity investments may influence public health outcomes and what behavioral factors may influence decision-makers' choices.</details><br><ol start=4><li><strong>Individual Unlearning in Process Management</strong>. Joint work with Kevin Linderman and Brent Moritz. Pilot studies completed.</li></ol><details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
Process management requires organizations to learn and adapt to new routines. While prior research primarily adopts an organizational learning perspective to study process and knowledge management, the "unlearning" procedure attracts more and more attention in recent years. This intentional effort in discarding old knowledge in order to embrace new knowledge is even considered a source of dynamic capability that organizations can leverage on. Although prior literature on organizational learning and change management has recognized individuals' role in shaping organizational level outcomes, there is relatively little research on how individual unlearning might contribute to firms' process improvement initiatives. Our study adopts an experimental approach to address this gap and develop a better understanding of the microfoundations of organizational unlearning in process management. We examine what kind of informational cues might help promote the unlearning process and improve learning outcomes and explore whether important individual characteristics, such as personality, influence different cues' efficacy. Preliminary data shows that different individuals may be susceptible to different cues and that there might be potential benefits of tailoring different cues to individuals with different characteristics.</details><p></p></div></div></article>
