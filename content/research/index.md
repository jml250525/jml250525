<ol><li><strong>Network Asymmetry and Supply Contract Competition</strong>. Joint work with Alper Nakkas and Kay-Yut Chen. will submit to <em>Management Science</em> soon.</li></ol>
  
<details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
We build a game-theoretic model to examine supply contract negotiations under competition when retailers have asymmetric supplier bases. We represent the asymmetric supplier bases with a two-retailer-two-supplier network in which one retailer has access to both suppliers and other retailer has access to only one supplier. The retailers first negotiate supply contracts with their suppliers to gain exclusive selling rights and then the retailers who manage to secure a contract with a supplier choose their market prices. The asymmetric structure of supply network together with retailer level competition dynamics determine the contract bargaining incentives of retailers and suppliers. We find that supply chain network asymmetry can lead to a retail monopoly when the suppliers' products are sufficiently substitutable. Further, if the substitutability level continues to rise, the retailer with larger supplier base gain benefits in contract agreement through negotiations. We also show that total industry profits can be higher under asymmetric network structure as compared to that under complete network structure. Overall, our research suggests that the supply chain network structure can fundamentally impact firms' contracting behaviors, and thus, needs to be considered to better reflect the reality of contractual negotiation under competition.</details>

<ol start=2><li><strong>Desperateness in Contract Bargaining under Supply Chain Networks</strong>. Joint work with Alper Nakkas, Kay-Yut Chen and Jason Xianghua Wu. will submit to <em>Management Science</em>.</li></ol>

<details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
This paper theoretically and behaviorally studies contract bargaining in two-sided supply chain networks where retailers on the demand side purchase products from suppliers on the supply side. The retailers may have heterogeneous market valuations on the products ordered from the supply partner. In such a supply chain network, a retailer and a supplier must have a business relationship or "link" to bargain and trade with each other. However, a firm on one side of the supply chain network might not have a business relationship with every firm on the other side. Our experimental data suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal behavioral regularities on contracting behaviors. In particular, we show that players who link with more (or less) potential partners and/or who have more (or less) perceived values tend to earn more (or less) than expectation in games. We develop a new behavioral theory, referred to as <em>desperateness theory</em>, which explains and predicts the contract bargaining behaviors in two-sided supply chain networks. We demonstrate that firm(s) who link with less potential partner or who have less perceived values in the networks are more desperate of making contract agreement, and thus need to "sacrifice" part of the contract bargaining payoffs when bargaining with the corresponding "advantageous" firm(s). We also find evidence that the higher the total desperateness within the supply chain network, the lower the total supply chain profit.</details>

<ol start=3><li><strong>Buyer-side Supply Chain Contract Auction</strong>. Joint work with Kay-Yut Chen. will submit to <em>Manufacturing & Service Operations Management</em>.</li></ol>

<details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
This paper studies a sales problem with one supplier and multiple potential retailers who face demand uncertainty and hold private information on their own processing costs. To find the most efficient retailer, the supplier first designs a simple supply contract that specifies a wholesale price of each possible selling product (or a fixed payment), and then invites the retailers to bid on the fixed payment (or the wholesale price). We name them Bid-on-F and Bid-on-W auction respectively. The winning retailer is the one who offers the highest bid in a sealed bid auction and can decide the purchase quantity before the demand uncertainty is resolved. We theoretically and behaviorally study and compare the Bid-on-F and Bid-on-W auction mechanisms. Our experimental data suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal behavioral regularities under each auction. In particular, under Bid-on-F auction (or Bid-on-W auction), suppliers set wholesale prices (or fixed fee) much higher (or lower) than what Bayesian-Nash equilibrium predicts. We also find that the winning retailers in both auction mechanisms order much more than the theoretical prediction, which breaks the well-known ``pull-to-center" effect shown in numerous newsvendor experiments. Motivated by these observations, we develop a behavioral model that incorporates bounded rationality and prospect theory. Empirical analysis indicates that our model provides a compelling explanation of the behavior observed in the data. Overall, this study provides implication on the design of the contract auction mechanism from supplier's perspective in decentralized supply chain structures.</details>

<ol start=4><li><strong>Can Artificial Intelligence Discover Trust and Trustworthiness?</strong>. Joint work with Jason Xianghua Wu, Kay-Yut Chen, Dianna Yan Wu. will submit to <em>Science</em>.</li></ol>

<details class=abstract><summary markdown=span>Summary (click to expand)</summary>
We develop deep neural network-based artificial intelligent (AI) agents to play the trust game, a simple economics scenario popular in the literature, to study trust and trustworthiness behaviors in human subjects. We establish that trust and trustworthiness behaviors, defined by the trust game, can be discovered by, and emerged from, self-learning processes of these artificial intelligence agents, under the right conditions. The training process involved no data that contains any information about trust, nor specific assumptions about trusts built into the process. Hence, we show that artificial intelligent agents can discover trust and trustworthiness behaviors by pure interacting and learning with one another. We also identify conditions, including caring about the future, have access to records of past actions and stable training partners, that enable trust and trustworthiness to emerge.</details><br>
