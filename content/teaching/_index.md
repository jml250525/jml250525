We build a game-theoretic model to examine supply contract negotiations under competition when retailers have asymmetric supplier bases. We represent the asymmetric supplier bases with a two-retailer-two-supplier network in which one retailer has access to both suppliers and other retailer has access to only one supplier. The retailers first negotiate supply contracts with their suppliers to gain exclusive selling rights and then the retailers who manage to secure a contract with a supplier choose their market prices. The asymmetric structure of supply network together with retailer level competition dynamics determine the contract bargaining incentives of retailers and suppliers. We find that supply chain network asymmetry can lead to a retail monopoly when the suppliers' products are sufficiently substitutable. Further, if the substitutability level continues to rise, the retailer with larger supplier base gain benefits in contract agreement through negotiations. We also show that total industry profits can be higher under asymmetric network structure as compared to that under complete network structure. Overall, our research suggests that the supply chain network structure can fundamentally impact firms' contracting behaviors, and thus, needs to be considered to better reflect the reality of contractual negotiation under competition.</details></li>

This paper theoretically and behaviorally studies contract bargaining in two-sided supply chain networks where retailers on the demand side purchase products from suppliers on the supply side. The retailers may have heterogeneous market valuations on the products ordered from the supply partner. In such a supply chain network, a retailer and a supplier must have a business relationship or "link" to bargain and trade with each other. However, a firm on one side of the supply chain network might not have a business relationship with every firm on the other side. Our experimental data suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal behavioral regularities on contracting behaviors. In particular, we show that players who link with more (or less) potential partners and/or who have more (or less) perceived values tend to earn more (or less) than expectation in games. We develop a new behavioral theory, referred to as <em>desperateness theory</em>, which explains and predicts the contract bargaining behaviors in two-sided supply chain networks. We demonstrate that firm(s) who link with less potential partner or who have less perceived values in the networks are more desperate of making contract agreement, and thus need to "sacrifice" part of the contract bargaining payoffs when bargaining with the corresponding "advantageous" firm(s). We also find evidence that the higher the total desperateness within the supply chain network, the lower the total supply chain profit.</details></li>
